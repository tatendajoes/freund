# Freund: Exciting Ways to Combat Emotional Support with Intelligence in Context

---

## **Milestones**

### **1. Speech Module**
**Purpose**: Enable seamless interaction through speech-based input and output.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **Audio Capture**: Using PyAudio for real-time recording of user speech.
  - **Speech Recognition**: Transcribing audio input with Google Speech Recognition API.
  - **Text-to-Speech**: Converting responses to speech using pyttsx3.
  - **Functional State**: The module is capable of capturing audio, processing transcription, and speaking out the generated responses.
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Handling silent spaces in real-time audio processing.
  - Integration with the conversational system for dynamic responses.

### **2. Vision Module**
**Purpose**: Provide real-time facial analysis for emotion and demographic detection.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **Webcam Integration**: Captures live video feed using OpenCV.
  - **Facial Analysis**: Uses DeepFace to extract attributes such as:
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Dominant Emotion
    - Dominant Race
  - **Visualization**: Displays detected attributes in real-time overlaid on the video feed.
- **Functional State**: Operational for single-frame analysis in a live stream.
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Ensuring robustness in varying lighting and environments.
  - Managing performance for real-time analysis.

### **3. Generation Module**
**Purpose**: Facilitate conversational capabilities using a multimodal LLM.
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **API Integration**: Configured Gemini API for multimodal conversational flows.
  - **Chat Loop**: Developed a conversational system combining:
    - Speech input (via Speech module)
    - LLM responses (via Gemini API)
    - Text-to-speech output.
- **Functional State**: The module supports basic conversational interactions and is integrated with the Speech module.
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Managing latency in API calls.
  - Adapting conversational outputs based on detected user attributes.

## **What Has Been Accomplished**
1. **Speech**: Functional pipeline from audio input to output.
2. **Vision**: Real-time webcam-based analysis with DeepFace integration.
3. **Generation**: Initial conversation loop with LLM integration using Gemini API.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Integration**: Combine all three modules into a cohesive pipeline.
2. **Optimization**: Address performance and latency issues, particularly in the Vision and Generation modules.
3. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Fine-tune emotion-based response generation.
   - Add fail-safes for edge cases (e.g., unclear speech or undetected faces).
4. **Interactive UI**: Developing a user-friendly interface, potentially using OpenCV or another Python library.
5. **Play API Integration**: Incorporating Play API for YouTube videos and engaging games.
6. **Testing and Continuous Development**: Ensuring robustness and expanding functionality through iterative testing and integration.
